    "  El objetivo de ese metodo data_cleaning es limpiar y preparar los datos del DataFrame df. para normalizar el texto y evitar problemas de incompatibilidad co respecto a la consulta. primero se convierte el texto a minúsculas, luego se eliminan los signos de puntuación y caracteres especiales, por ejemplo, si el texto contiene hello y el query contiene \"!Hello!\" independientemente de los signos el texto es relevante para la consulta y esta limpieza hará que sea más facil la obtención de estos textos, se tokeniza el texto en palabras individuales, se eliminan las stopwords (palabras comunes que no aportan significado) y finalmente se aplica lematización para reducir las palabras a su forma base. El resultado es un DataFrame con columnas 'title' y 'text' que contienen listas de palabras limpias y normalizadas.\n",
